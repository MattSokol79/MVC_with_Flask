# Project Details
(buying tickets probably??)

Epic story 
enter airport, check in luggage - data is available to airport staff
go to security desk, give in your items to get checked
is ticket valid
is passport valid
is visa/passport valid for the destination


As a user I want to build a project where a 
customer can buy ticket -> can sr how many seats are available
if the seats is sold, minus the seat from total number of seats

when planning to sell tickets 250 seats availabel
each seat £100. Classes!! 100 seats = £10000
Prices are according to ages, i.e. children
2-12 are like 60% of adult price ticket

Build something to be used in a real life
scenario, i.e. making it a realistic website

Each group needs a scrum board, scrum master
